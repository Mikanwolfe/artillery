**Artillery II** or Artillery is a 2D physics-based point-to-point shooter best described as 'tanks' from one side. Players move their *artillery pieces* across a randomly-generated map and interact with map effects to destroy one another. 

Artillery II refers to the extension of the original program, Artillery, however they are now one and the same.

**Features:**

* Midpoint displacement terrain generation
* Destructible terrain
* Three vehicles to choose from
* Effects appear on map (mirror, power-up, split)
* Wind
* Air resistance for all weapons

**Controls:**

| Command       | Key                  |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Move          | `Left, Right`        |
| Aim Weapon    | `Up, Down`           |
| Charge Weaopn | `Spacebar` (Hold)    |
| Fire          | `Spacebar` (Release) |

### The Project

Artillery II is the result of a High Distinction Project for COS10007: Introduction to Programming and is written procedurally in Pascal. It acts as a central learning experience for both the strengths and the weaknesses of procedural programming and the workflow required to produce high-quality, robust, and extensive programs. From a limited programming background, Artillery illustrates the requirement to think from a different point of view when approaching programming topics and the implementation of real-world ideas (such as the diamond-square/midpoint displacement algorithm) into code.

Artillery II received full marks for this unit, classified as "something special" compared to other HD Projects.

#### Artillery II Package

Artillery II was written in Pascal with SwinGame (see [here](http://swingame.com/) for more details). As it was along time ago, there are two recommendations for working with what remains: 

1. There should be a binary, presumably it's safe. 
2. Run MinGW and run the `build.sh` file. For more details consult SwinGame.

Artillery II has a sequel! Artillery3! See [here](https://github.com/Mikanwolfe/Artillery3) for more details!

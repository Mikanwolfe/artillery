# The Artillery Project
High Distinction Project for COS10001, Swinburne University of Technology

by mikanwolfe, mikanwolfe@nekox.net



Artillery II (Artillery) was the result of the High Distinction Project for Swinburne's Introduction to Programming unit. Don't let the name fool you, Artillery II scored a 100/100 for that unit. Written in Pascal, Artillery uses Swinburne's SwinGame API to draw elements to the window itself. 

Artillery was my stepping stone into proper programming, as before this I was self-taught and therefore, my code wasn't very refined nor did it follow good convention.

This README is a work in progress, I will update this with my "Design Document" that I produced along with proper documentation  and compiliation instructions.
